Japan played two friendlies, a 2–0 win against Nigeria on October 6, and a 2–0 win against New Zealand on October 8. Endo was on the bench, but did not play, against Nigeria. She started in the New Zealand match and played 82 minutes.  Scotland, meanwhile, was in the playoff round of World Cup qualifiers. Emslie played every minute of Scotland's two games, a 1–0 extra-time defeat of Austria, and a 0–1 loss to Republic of Ireland. The loss to Ireland means they will not compete at the 2023 World Cup.","Url":"https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Angel-City-Football-Club-New-Logo.png","Category":"Sport"}]
